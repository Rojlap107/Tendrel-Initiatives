                    Dhardon Sharling is an interdisciplinary scholar-activist with over two decades of experience in
                    public advocacy communication, democracy promotion, and advancing gender, social, and climate
                    justice.
                    She serves as a Lecturer in Communication at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she
                    earned
                    her Ph.D. in Communication and a Graduate Certificate in Feminist Studies. She also holds an
                    M.Sc. in
                    Counselling Studies from the University of Edinburgh.

                <p>
                    Dhardon's action research explores how human communication practices, particularly through
                    emerging media,
                    can advance social change and environmental consciousness. The Dalai Lama's moral, intellectual,
                    and
                    spiritual leadership has been central to her field of inquiry. Her doctoral dissertation
                    examined his
                    promotion of human values and environmental ethics, and her publications include "Theorizing a
                    Female
                    Dalai Lama"—a feminist intervention—and studies on the Dalai Lama's role in shaping Tibetan
                    identity,
                    resilience, and political mobilization.

                <p>
                    She co-authored <em>The Power of the Feminine</em> with international feminist scholars and
                    climate
                    advocates—a collaborative work that critiques patriarchal leadership models and calls for a
                    shift in
                    human consciousness to address ecological crises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dhardon's career includes serving as Information Secretary of the Central Tibetan
                    Administration, Member
                    of the Tibetan Parliament in Exile, and Research and Media Executive at Tibetan Women's
                    Association. She
                    has also taught at Hampshire College and Syracuse University, contributed to leading academic
                    journals,
                    and currently serves as Associate Editor of Anthropology of Consciousness.
