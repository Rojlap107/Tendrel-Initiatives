                    Rooted in the Tibetan concept of tendrel—interdependence and auspicious connection—the TenDrel
                    Initiative envisions a world where mind, media, and moral imagination meet to shape a more equitable
                    and sustainable planet. Anchored in the moral, intellectual, and spiritual leadership of His
                    Holiness
                    the 14th Dalai Lama, TenDrel recognizes the interconnectedness of all life and seeks to strengthen
                    humanity's shared responsibility for planetary care—especially in the age of climate change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grounded in its founder's vision as a scholar-activist and animated by a deep passion for
                    storytelling,
                    the TenDrel Initiative bridges reflection and transformation—bringing together thinkers, creators,
                    and
                    changemakers to imagine new pathways for planetary care. Through multimedia projects, thought
                    leadership,
                    and participatory inquiry, it models a conscious approach to an interconnected planet.

                <p class="intro-highlight">
                    Ultimately, the TenDrel Initiative invites reflection and participation toward a more conscious,
                    equitable, and sustainable planet—reminding us that <strong>planetary care begins with a conscious
                        mind.</strong>

                        Through multimedia projects, thought leadership, and participatory inquiry, TenDrel invites

                    <h2>The Black-Necked Crane: A Living Symbol of Interconnection</h2>
                    <p>
                        At the heart of TenDrel Initiative's visual language is the black-necked crane, a sacred bird
                        of the Tibetan plateau whose flight embodies tendrel—interdependence and auspicious connection.
                        Revered across Tibetan and Himalayan cultures, the crane symbolizes longevity, wisdom, purity,
                        and good fortune. In Tibetan Buddhist imagination, it is a messenger between earth and sky,
                        associated with spiritual elevation and rebirth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For TenDrel, the crane is both a moral and ecological symbol—reminding us that human values,
                        cultural wisdom, and planetary responsibility are inseparable.

                    <p>
                        The logo of the TenDrel Initiative features the Tibetan Endless Knot (Palbeu), an ancient symbol
                        of interdependence, balance, and continuity. Its seamless design—without beginning or
                        end—embodies
                        TenDrel's core belief that everything is connected: consciousness, technology, ecology, and
                        ethics.
                        The knot reflects humanity's ongoing moral evolution and expresses the vision of "moral futures"
                        at the heart of TenDrel's mission. Rooted in Tibetan Buddhist philosophy yet universally
                        resonant,
                        the symbol honors ancient wisdom while embracing contemporary relevance. It conveys TenDrel
                        Initiative's
                        mission: weaving mind, media, and moral imagination.

                        Dhardon Sharling is an interdisciplinary scholar-activist with over two decades of experience in
                        public advocacy communication, democracy promotion, and advancing gender, social, and climate
                        justice.
                        She serves as a Lecturer in Communication at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she
                        earned
                        her Ph.D. in Communication and a Graduate Certificate in Feminist Studies. She also holds an
                        M.Sc. in
                        Counselling Studies from the University of Edinburgh.

                    <p>
                        Dhardon's action research explores how human communication practices, particularly through
                        emerging media,
                        can advance social change and environmental consciousness. The Dalai Lama's moral, intellectual,
                        and
                        spiritual leadership has been central to her field of inquiry. Her doctoral dissertation
                        examined his
                        promotion of human values and environmental ethics, and her publications include "Theorizing a
                        Female
                        Dalai Lama"—a feminist intervention—and studies on the Dalai Lama's role in shaping Tibetan
                        identity,
                        resilience, and political mobilization.

                    <p>
                        She co-authored <em>The Power of the Feminine</em> with international feminist scholars and
                        climate
                        advocates—a collaborative work that critiques patriarchal leadership models and calls for a
                        shift in
                        human consciousness to address ecological crises.

                        Dhardon's career includes serving as Information Secretary of the Central Tibetan
